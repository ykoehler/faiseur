# CI/CD Status and GitHub Actions Configuration

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Web platform working, iOS/Android commented out for later configuration

---

## Current CI/CD Setup

### Workflows Configured

Three GitHub Actions workflows are configured:

1. **Pull Request CI** (`.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml`)
   - Runs on all PRs to `develop` and `main`
   - Jobs: analyze, test, build-web, build-macos, integration-test, security-scan
   - Status: ✅ **Working**

2. **Deploy to Staging** (`.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`)
   - Triggered on push to `develop` branch
   - Builds and deploys web to Firebase Hosting (staging)
   - Status: ✅ **Ready** (requires `FIREBASE_OPTIONS_STAGING` secret)

3. **Deploy to Production** (`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`)
   - Triggered on push to `main` branch
   - Web deployment: ✅ **Active**
   - iOS deployment: ❌ **Commented out** (waiting for secrets)
   - Android deployment: ❌ **Commented out** (waiting for secrets)
   - Status: ⚠️ **Partially working**

## Recent GitHub Action Failure (Main Branch Merge)

### What Happened

When you merged to `main`, the production deployment workflow attempted to run but failed because:

**Issue**: The workflow was trying to reference secrets and job outputs that weren't properly configured.

**Root Cause**: The `deploy-production.yml` workflow had:
1. iOS and Android jobs requiring secrets that weren't configured
2. Post-deployment job referencing outputs from jobs that might fail
3. Slack notifications trying to use undefined secrets

### What Was Fixed

✅ **iOS deployment job is now commented out**
- Full job code preserved in comments
- Includes documentation of required secrets
- Can be uncommented when ready

✅ **Android deployment job is now commented out**  
- Full job code preserved in comments
- Includes documentation of required secrets
- Can be uncommented when ready

✅ **Post-deployment job updated**
- Now only depends on `deploy-production` (web)
- Shows status of iOS/Android as "Pending"
- Includes instructions for enabling them later

✅ **Slack notification made optional**
- Will only run if `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is configured
- Won't fail the workflow if secret is missing

## GitHub Secrets Currently Configured

### For Web Platform ✅

**Configured**:
- `FIREBASE_OPTIONS_PROD` - Firebase production config
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROD` - Firebase service account
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_PROD` - Firebase project ID

**Status**: ✅ Web deployment should work

### For Staging Platform ✅

**Configured**:
- `FIREBASE_OPTIONS_STAGING` - Firebase staging config
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_STAGING` - Firebase service account
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_STAGING` - Firebase project ID

**Status**: ✅ Staging deployment should work

### For iOS Platform ❌ (Delayed)

**Required but not configured**:
- `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` - Base64-encoded provisioning profile
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_P12` - Base64-encoded certificate
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` - Certificate password
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` - API key ID
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID` - API issuer ID
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY` - API key

**Status**: ⏸️ Commented out, ready for later

### For Android Platform ❌ (Delayed)

**Required but not configured**:
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE` - Base64-encoded keystore
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` - Keystore password

## How to Fix the Failing Workflow

### Option 1: Next Merge (Just Web Platform)

The workflow should now work for web-only deployments. When you merge to `main` next time:

1. ✅ Pre-deployment checks run (tests, analysis)
2. ✅ Web builds and deploys to Firebase Hosting
3. ✅ iOS/Android jobs are skipped (commented out)
4. ✅ Workflow completes successfully

### Option 2: Enable iOS Later

When you're ready to enable iOS deployments:

1. Add iOS secrets to GitHub repository settings
2. In `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`:
   - Uncomment the `deploy-ios:` section (lines 131-191)
   - Update `post-deployment` needs to: `needs: [deploy-production, deploy-ios]`

### Option 3: Enable Android Later

When you're ready to enable Android deployments:

1. Add Android secrets to GitHub repository settings
2. In `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`:
   - Uncomment the `deploy-android:` section (lines 193-267)
   - Update `post-deployment` needs to: `needs: [deploy-production, deploy-ios, deploy-android]`

## PR CI Workflow Status

### Current Status: ✅ Working

The PR workflow (`pr-ci.yml`) runs on all pull requests and includes:

- ✅ **Code Analysis** - Flutter analyze + formatting check
- ✅ **Unit & Widget Tests** - Runs all tests, uploads coverage
- ✅ **Web Build** - Builds for dev environment
- ✅ **macOS Build** - Builds for dev environment
- ✅ **Integration Tests** - Runs with Firebase emulators
- ✅ **Security Scan** - Trivy vulnerability scanner
- ✅ **PR Summary** - Posts comment with results

### Note on Staging Deployment

The staging workflow (`deploy-staging.yml`) is also configured and will:
- Deploy when you push to `develop` branch
- Build web and deploy to Firebase Hosting (staging)
- Status: ✅ Ready to use

## Next Steps

### Immediate (To Get Main Branch Deployments Working)

The production workflow should now work as-is:
1. Merge to `main`
2. Workflow runs pre-deployment checks
3. Web deploys to Firebase Hosting
4. Post-deployment summary shows iOS/Android as pending

### When Ready to Add iOS Support

1. Obtain iOS provisioning profile and certificate
2. Create GitHub secrets for iOS (see secret names in workflow)
3. Uncomment iOS job in production workflow
4. Update post-deployment needs array

### When Ready to Add Android Support

1. Obtain Android keystore and Play Store credentials
2. Create GitHub secrets for Android (see secret names in workflow)
3. Uncomment Android job in production workflow
4. Update post-deployment needs array

---

## Testing the Workflow

### Test PR Workflow

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make a change
3. Create a PR to `develop`
4. Verify all CI checks pass

### Test Staging Deployment

1. Merge PR to `develop`
2. Check GitHub Actions tab
3. Verify "Deploy to Staging" workflow completes
4. Check Firebase Console → Hosting → staging.faiseur.app

### Test Production Deployment (Web Only)

1. Merge PR to `main`
2. Check GitHub Actions tab
3. Verify "Deploy to Production" workflow completes
4. Check Firebase Console → Hosting → faiseur.app

## Workflow Files Locations

- `.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml` - Pull request validation
- `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` - Staging deployment
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` - Production deployment

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Secrets not found" error

**Cause**: Secret name mismatch or secret not configured

**Solution**:
1. Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets
2. Verify secret name matches exactly in workflow
3. Add missing secret if needed

### Issue: "Job failed: deploy-ios"

**Cause**: iOS job is commented out or iOS secrets missing

**Solution**:
- This is expected - iOS job is intentionally commented out
- To enable, follow "When Ready to Add iOS Support" section above

### Issue: "Job failed: deploy-android"

**Cause**: Android job is commented out or Android secrets missing

**Solution**:
- This is expected - Android job is intentionally commented out
- To enable, follow "When Ready to Add Android Support" section above

### Issue: Slack notifications failing

**Cause**: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` not configured

**Solution**:
- Slack notifications are optional
- Either add the secret or ignore the notification failure
- Web deployment will still succeed

## Summary

✅ **Web deployment**: Ready to go  
✅ **Staging deployment**: Ready to go  
✅ **PR validation**: Working  
⏸️ **iOS deployment**: Commented out, ready for future setup  
⏸️ **Android deployment**: Commented out, ready for future setup  

**Your next merge to `main` should succeed with web-only deployment.**
