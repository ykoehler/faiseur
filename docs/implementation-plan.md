## Implementation Strategy

### Approach

**Iterative Development with Continuous Deployment**

Each phase delivers a **fully functional, releasable app** that meets app store standards, even if features are limited. This approach allows for:

1. **Early user feedback**: Get real users testing early
2. **Reduced risk**: Smaller releases are easier to debug
3. **Faster time to market**: MVP in users' hands quickly
4. **Continuous validation**: Verify assumptions with real usage
5. **Flexible pivoting**: Adjust based on feedback

### Release Criteria

Each phase must meet:

- ✅ All tests passing (unit, widget, integration)
- ✅ No critical bugs or crashes
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ App store guidelines compliance (iOS, Android)
- ✅ Security review passed
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Privacy policy and terms updated
- ✅ Changelog updated

### Platform Rollout Order

1. **Web**: Primary development and debugging platform
2. **macOS**: Desktop validation
3. **iOS**: Mobile polish and review
4. **Android**: Final platform implementation
