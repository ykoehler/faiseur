---

## Checklist: What Was Done

### 1. Route Constants ✅

**File**: `lib/routing/app_routes.dart`

```dart
✅ const String kOnboardingRoute = '/onboarding'
✅ const String kOnboardingWelcomeRoute = '/onboarding/welcome'
✅ const String kOnboardingRouteName = 'onboarding'
✅ Updated allDefinedRoutes set
✅ Updated allDefinedRouteNames set
```

**Verification**:
```
lib/routing/app_routes.dart: 6 matches found
✅ All route constants present
✅ Sets properly updated
```

### 2. GoRouter Integration ✅

**File**: `lib/routing/app_router.dart`

```dart
✅ Imported OnboardingPage
✅ Added _buildOnboardingRoute() function
✅ Registered route in GoRouter
✅ Updated redirect logic with Ref parameter
✅ Onboarding redirect logic implemented
```

**Verification**:
```
lib/routing/app_router.dart: 4 route references
✅ OnboardingPage imported
✅ _buildOnboardingRoute() defined and called
✅ Route builder properly structured
✅ Redirect returns kOnboardingWelcomeRoute for auth users
```

### 3. Navigation Service ✅

**File**: `lib/routing/navigation_service.dart`

```dart
✅ void goToOnboarding() - Navigate to onboarding
✅ void completeOnboarding() - Navigate to lists after onboarding
✅ Properly integrated with GoRouter
```

**Verification**:
```
lib/routing/navigation_service.dart: 1 method match
✅ goToOnboarding() method added
✅ completeOnboarding() method added
```

---

## Navigation Flow Implementation

### Redirect Logic

The updated `_handleRedirect()` function now implements:

```
Priority Order:
1. App not ready? → /splash
2. Not authenticated? → /auth/login
3. Authenticated on auth routes? → /onboarding/welcome
4. Authenticated on splash? → /onboarding/welcome
5. Everything else allowed
```

**Code Location**: `lib/routing/app_router.dart` lines 84-175

### Route Registration

Onboarding route registered at:
```
routes: [
  _buildSplashRoute(),
  _buildOnboardingRoute(),     ← NEW
  _buildAuthRoutes(),
  _buildMainRoutes(),
  _buildErrorRoute()
]
```

**Code Location**: `lib/routing/app_router.dart` line 60

## Route Map

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Navigation Route Structure After Step 1.8                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

/splash
  └─ SplashPage (initialization screen)

/onboarding                          ← NEW
  ├─ path: 'onboarding'
  └─ routes:
     └─ welcome
        ├─ name: 'onboarding' (kOnboardingRouteName)
        └─ builder: OnboardingPage

/auth
  ├─ login → LoginPage
  ├─ signup → SignupPage
  └─ forgot-password → SplashPage

/lists                              (after onboarding)
  ├─ lists → ListsPage
  └─ :listId

## Type-Safe Navigation Examples

### Using Route Constants
```dart
// Navigate to onboarding
context.goNamed(kOnboardingRouteName);

// Navigate to lists (after onboarding)
context.goNamed(kListsRouteName);

// Using navigation service
final navService = ref.read(navigationServiceProvider);
navService.goToOnboarding();
navService.completeOnboarding();
```

### Checking Routes
```dart
// Verify route exists
assert(allDefinedRoutes.contains(kOnboardingRoute));
assert(allDefinedRouteNames.contains(kOnboardingRouteName));
```

## Integration Points

### Works With Step 1.9 ✅
- Onboarding feature (created in Step 1.9) is now routable
- Tutorial list creation integrated
- State management (Riverpod) connected

### Works With Phase C ✅
- GoRouter infrastructure (from Phase C) utilized
- Redirect logic follows established patterns
- Navigation service extended consistently

### Works With Step 1.3 ✅
- Authentication state provider used in redirects
- Auth routes properly guarded
- User context passed correctly
